#1. Define a class which has at least two methods one, to get a string 
#from console  input and other is to print the string in uppercase.
class StringManipulator:

# Create an instance of the class
string_manipulator = StringManipulator()

# Get input from the user
string_manipulator.get_input()

# Print the input string in uppercase
string_manipulator.print_uppercase()
#2. Define a class, which have a class parameter and have a same instance 
#parameter.
class MyClass:
    param = None  # Class parameter (class attribute)

#3. Define a class named Circle which can be constructed by radius.

#4. Define a class named BankAccount. This class should contain
#  methods withdraw() and deposit to calculate the balance amount remained 
#  in your account.

            print("Invalid withdrawal amount. Please withdraw a positive amount.")

account.withdraw(50)

# Try to withdraw an invalid amount and an amount exceeding the balance
account.withdraw(200)
account.withdraw(-10)

# Deposit another $75
account.deposit(75)
#5.Define a class named Shape and its subclass Square.the Square class 
# has an init function which takes a length as argument. Both classes
# have a area function which can print the area of the shape where 
# Shape's area is 0 by default. 


class Shape:
    def area(self):
        return 0  # Default area for the base Shape class

class Square(Shape):
    def __init__(self, length):
        self.length = length

    def area(self):
        return self.length ** 2  # Area of a square is length * length

# Create instances of the Shape and Square classes
shape = Shape()
square = Square(4)  # Creating a square with a side length of 4

# Calculate and print the areas
print("Area of the generic shape:", shape.area())  # Calls the base class method (0 by default)
print("Area of the square:", square.area())  # Calls the overridden method (16 for a 4x4 square)
